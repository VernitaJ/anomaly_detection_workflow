        The testing phase of a software system is a crucial stage in the
        software development lifecycle. It involves testing the software system
        against the requirements defined during the software analysis phase to
        ensure that it meets the specified requirements. The testing phase
        typically includes several types of testing, including{" "}
        <b>
          unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance
          testing.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        System testing involves testing the entire software system as a whole to
        ensure that it meets the specified requirements. This testing is
        typically carried out by a dedicated testing team and may involve the
        use of manual or automated testing tools. Acceptance testing involves
        testing the software system against the requirements defined by the
        client or end-user to ensure that it meets their needs. This testing is
        typically carried out by the client or end-user and may involve the use
        of user acceptance testing (UAT) tools. Overall, the testing phase is
        critical to ensuring that the software system performs as expected and
        meets the specified requirements. By identifying and fixing defects
        during this phase, developers can improve the quality and reliability of
        the software system before it is released to users.

        The output of this step includes test results, which describe the
        state of the system.

      <h4>Unit Testing</h4>
      <p>
        Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of the
        software system to ensure that they perform as expected. This testing is
        typically carried out by developers themselves and may involve the use
        of automated testing tools.{" "}

      <h4>Integration Testing</h4>
      <p>
        Integration testing involves testing the integration between different
        components or modules of the software system. This testing is performed
        to ensure that the individual components or modules function correctly
        when integrated with other components or modules.{" "}
