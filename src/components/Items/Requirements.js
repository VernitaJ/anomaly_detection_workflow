        The requirements gathering process involves collecting and documenting
        the necessary features and functionalities of the system to be developed
        with the relevant stakeholders. This includes identifying the business
        problem that the anomaly detection system will solve and defining the
        specific use case(s) for the system. The stakeholders will collaborate
        to identify the data sources and data types required for the system to
        work. These stakeholders will also define the performance metrics for
        the anomaly detection system and establish the data quality
        requirements.

        The output of this step is a document containing the <b>project requirements</b>
        , which is a detailed document that outlines the domain context, use
        case(s), data sources, data types, performance metrics for the model and
        the anomaly detection, and data quality requirements.
