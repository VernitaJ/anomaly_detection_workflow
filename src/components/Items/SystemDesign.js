        The system design phase involves creating detailed specifications for
        the system based on the requirements document. This step includes
        defining the <b>architecture</b> of the system, choosing the appropriate{" "}
        <b>technologies</b> and <b>tools</b> to be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The domain context, as well as the requirements document is used to
        determine the system architecture. The system architecture includes the{" "}
        <b>data flow architecture</b>, and the <b>integration</b> of the system
        with existing systems, if required. The stakeholders will design the
        data processing pipeline that will ingest, preprocess, and clean the
        data. The project owner or system owner will ensure that the system
        architecture aligns with the project requirements.

      <p>Stakeholders: Project Manager, Data Scientist, Software Engineer</p>

      <h4>Output:</h4>
      <p>
        The output of this step is a detailed <b>system architecture</b>{" "}
        document that outlines the hardware, software, data flow, and
        integration.
